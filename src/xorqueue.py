        xorqueue(start: int, length: int)
    Equivalent to forming a square matrix of size `length**2`, consisting of the integers
    from `start` to `start + length**2 -1` inclusive, in row major order, then `xor`ing the 
    entries in the upper anti-triangle of the matrix as the return value.

    `start` should be nonnegative.
    `length` should be strictly positive, and such that `start + length**2 - 1 < MAX_WORKER_ID`

    E.g.
    `xorqueue(17,4)` is equivalent to generating the matrix
    ```
    17 18 19 20
    21 22 23 24
    25 26 27 28
    29 30 31 32
    ```
    then `xor`ing together the integers of the upper anti-triangle
    ```
    17 18 19 20
    21 22 23
    25 26
    29
    ```
    to give the result 14.

    Queue can't wrap after worker `MAX_WORKER_ID`, because they'd reorganise themselves to be in
    increasing ID order and with no gaps.

    Verifier complains about solution with list comprehension, so reworking to eliminate it and
    replace by a nested for loop. List comprehension could lead to very big and/or slow list, but
    we don't need to store a list, we just need to accumulate them with xor.

    OK none of the improvements and checks I've made has solved the problem of the three failing  
    test cases. There's no error in the logic of the indices. Possibly passing in a float that is equal 
    to an integer, like `1.0 == 1`, isn't happening. The queue ending early because worker MAX_WORKER_ID
    occurs in the middle of the matrix (and the matrix is always sorted in order with no gaps) isn't happening.

    If there's no logic problem and no input problem, then the problem must be space or time. We took care of the
    space problem by eliminating the construction of the list, but that didn't solve the problem.

    So we're left with a time problem. Potentially we're xor-ing together hundreds of millions of integers. We need
    to look for properties which will allow us to speed things up.

    `x ^ x == 0` is a useful one. So ^ is self-cancelling (idempotent).

    ^ is also commutative, associative, and 0 is the identity of the operation. This allows `x ^ y ^ x == y`, and so
    `1 ^ ... ^ y == 1 ^ ... ^ x ^ (x + 1) ^ ... ^ y`, which allows `(1 ^ ... ^ x) ^ (1 ^ ... ^ y) == (x + 1) ^ ... ^ y`. 
    We can also write `1 ^ ... ^ y == 0 ^ 1 ^ ... ^ y`. But all this isn't enough to shorten the number of consecutive
    numbers we may need to xor. There are still millions.

    But now there's a nice property of xor such that sequences of length 4 starting from a multiple of 4 xor together to 0,
    i.e. `4n ^ (4n + 1) ^ (4n + 2) ^ (4n + 3) == 0`. So, then if `y = 4n + k`, with `0 <= k <= 3`, we have
    `0 ^ ... ^ y ==` 
        * `4n`, if `k == 0`;
        * `4n ^ (4n + 1) == 1`, if `k == 1`;
        * `4n ^ (4n + 1) ^ (4n + 2) == 4n + 3`, if `k == 2`;
        * `4n ^ (4n + 1) ^ (4n + 2) ^ (4n + 3) == 0`, if `k == 3`.

    Putting these properties together we can dramatically shrink the number of xor computations we need.
